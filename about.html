            <p>At first glance, Wine Valet is a tech company that is developing an algorithm to personalise 
                wine recommendations. However, WHY Wine Valet exists is to share stories of grit and 
                passion with the world. Many of the wineries we work with are owned by families who 
                pursue the dream of winemaking, which is a tough gig most of the time. There are floods, 
                and drought, and frost, and financial troubles, yet year after year these families prune their 
                vines, wait for the grapes to grow, pick, crush and make a unique product vintage on 
                vintage. Wine Valet exists to share the passion of winemaking with the world.

                    <h3>MANAGING DIRECTOR (CEO)</h3>
                    <p>Alain Guillemain is a quintessential entrepreneur, and Wine Valet is his most fitting enterprise.With a 
                        breadth of backgrounds and qualifications,Alain navigates the complexities of managing a startup with 
                        competence, panache and surgical precision.
                        <br>
                        Alain has training in Multimedia, Business and Commerce, and has worked in roles in each of these fields. 
                        After completing his first degree, Alain worked as a software developer for five years. Restless at being 
                        “just a developer,” Alain sought to expand his knowledge in business and commerce to utilise technology 
                        for strategic impact, instead of simply building technology for technology’s sake.

                    <h2>Sarah Sweeney</h2>
                    <h3> DIRECTOR</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sarah Sweeney is a businesswoman based in Brisbane. She is trained as an Optometrist and practices 
                        part-time in Brisbane. Sarah is a serial investor, with Wine Valet being the third start-up she has invested 
                        in. Her first start-up, an optometry practice with multiple locations in Brisbane, was cultivated and 
                        profitably sold at the start of 2020.
                        <br>
                        To much chagrin, Sarah invested the entire proceeds from the sale of her first start-up into a company 
                        called Artios Corporation Pty Ltd, which purchased an optometry practice in the Brisbane CBD in March 
                        2020.The deal settled on 11 March 2020, and the practice was forced to close on 23 March 2020 due to 
                        COVID-19.
